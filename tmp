     The kkqquueeuuee() system call allocates a kqueue file descriptor.  This file
     descriptor provides a generic method of notifying the user when a kernel
     event (kevent) happens or a condition holds, based on the results of
     small pieces of kernel code termed filters.

     A kevent is identified by an (ident, filter, and optional udata value)
     tuple.  It specifies the interesting conditions to be notified about for
     that tuple. An (ident, filter, and optional udata value) tuple can only
     appear once in a given kqueue.  Subsequent attempts to register the same
     tuple for a given kqueue will result in the replacement of the conditions
     being watched, not an addition.  Whether the udata value is considered as
     part of the tuple is controlled by the EV_UDATA_SPECIFIC flag on the
     kevent.

     The filter identified in a kevent is executed upon the initial
     registration of that event in order to detect whether a preexisting
     condition is present, and is also executed whenever an event is passed to
     the filter for evaluation.  If the filter determines that the condition
     should be reported, then the kevent is placed on the kqueue for the user
     to retrieve.

     The filter is also run when the user attempts to retrieve the kevent from
     the kqueue.  If the filter indicates that the condition that triggered
     the event no longer holds, the kevent is removed from the kqueue and is
     not returned.

     Multiple events which trigger the filter do not result in multiple
     kevents being placed on the kqueue; instead, the filter will aggregate
     the events into a single struct kevent.  Calling cclloossee() on a file
     descriptor will remove any kevents that reference the descriptor.

     The kkqquueeuuee() system call creates a new kernel event queue and returns a
     descriptor.  The queue is not inherited by a child created with fork(2).

     The kkeevveenntt,,() kkeevveenntt6644() and kkeevveenntt__qqooss() system calls are used to
     register events with the queue, and return any pending events to the
     user.  The _c_h_a_n_g_e_l_i_s_t argument is a pointer to an array of _k_e_v_e_n_t_,
     _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s or _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s structures, as defined in ⟨_s_y_s_/_e_v_e_n_t_._h⟩.  All
     changes contained in the _c_h_a_n_g_e_l_i_s_t are applied before any pending events
     are read from the queue.  The _n_c_h_a_n_g_e_s argument gives the size of
     _c_h_a_n_g_e_l_i_s_t.

     The _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t argument is a pointer to an array of out _k_e_v_e_n_t_, _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s
     or _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s structures.  The _n_e_v_e_n_t_s argument determines the size of
     _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t.

     The _d_a_t_a___o_u_t argument provides space for extra out data provided by
     specific filters.  The _d_a_t_a___a_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e argument's contents specified the
     space available in the data pool on input, and contains the amount still
     remaining on output.  If the KEVENT_FLAG_STACK_DATA flag is specified on
     the system call, the data is allocated from the pool in stack order
     instead of typical heap order.

     If _t_i_m_e_o_u_t is a non-NULL pointer, it specifies a maximum interval to wait
     for an event, which will be interpreted as a struct timespec.  If _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
     is a NULL pointer, both kkeevveenntt() and kkeevveenntt6644() wait indefinitely.  To
     effect a poll, the _f_l_a_g_s argument to kkeevveenntt6644() or kkeevveenntt__qqooss() can
     include the KEVENT_FLAG_IMMEDIATE value to indicate an immediate timeout.
     Alternatively, the _t_i_m_e_o_u_t argument should be non-NULL, pointing to a
     zero-valued _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure.  The same array may be used for the
     _c_h_a_n_g_e_l_i_s_t and _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t.

     The EEVV__SSEETT() macro is provided for ease of initializing a _k_e_v_e_n_t
     structure. Similarly, EEVV__SSEETT6644() initializes a _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s structure and
     EEVV__SSEETT__QQOOSS() initializes a _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s structure.

     The _k_e_v_e_n_t_, _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s and _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s structures are defined as:

     The fields of _s_t_r_u_c_t _k_e_v_e_n_t_, _s_t_r_u_c_t _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s and _s_t_r_u_c_t _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s
     are:

     ident      Value used to identify the source of the event.  The exact
                interpretation is determined by the attached filter, but often
                is a file descriptor.

     filter     Identifies the kernel filter used to process this event.  The
                pre-defined system filters are described below.

     flags      Actions to perform on the event.

     fflags     Filter-specific flags.

     data       Filter-specific data value.

     udata      Opaque user-defined value passed through the kernel unchanged.
                It can optionally be part of the uniquing decision of the
                kevent system

     In addition, _s_t_r_u_c_t _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s contains:

     ext[2]     This field stores extensions for the event's filter. What type
                of extension depends on what type of filter is being used.

     In addition, _s_t_r_u_c_t _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s contains:

     xflags     Extra filter-specific flags.

     ext[4]     The QoS variant provides twice as many extension values for
                filter-specific uses.

     ----

     The _f_l_a_g_s field can contain the following values:

     EV_ADD         Adds the event to the kqueue.  Re-adding an existing event
                    will modify the parameters of the original event, and not
                    result in a duplicate entry.  Adding an event
                    automatically enables it, unless overridden by the
                    EV_DISABLE flag.

     EV_ENABLE      Permit kkeevveenntt,,() kkeevveenntt6644() and kkeevveenntt__qqooss() to return the
                    event if it is triggered.

     EV_DISABLE     Disable the event so kkeevveenntt,,() kkeevveenntt6644() and kkeevveenntt__qqooss()
                    will not return it.  The filter itself is not disabled.

     EV_DELETE      Removes the event from the kqueue.  Events which are
                    attached to file descriptors are automatically deleted on
                    the last close of the descriptor.

     EV_RECEIPT     This flag is useful for making bulk changes to a kqueue
                    without draining any pending events. When passed as input,
                    it forces EV_ERROR to always be returned.  When a filter
                    is successfully added, the _d_a_t_a field will be zero.

     EV_ONESHOT     Causes the event to return only the first occurrence of
                    the filter being triggered.  After the user retrieves the
                    event from the kqueue, it is deleted.

     EV_CLEAR       After the event is retrieved by the user, its state is
                    reset.  This is useful for filters which report state
                    transitions instead of the current state.  Note that some
                    filters may automatically set this flag internally.

     EV_EOF         Filters may set this flag to indicate filter-specific EOF
                    condition.

     EV_OOBAND      Read filter on socket may set this flag to indicate the
                    presence of out of band data on the descriptor.

     EV_ERROR       See _R_E_T_U_R_N _V_A_L_U_E_S below.

     ----

     The predefined system filters are listed below.  Arguments may be passed
     to and from the filter via the _d_a_t_a_, _f_f_l_a_g_s and optionally _x_f_l_a_g_s fields
     in the _k_e_v_e_n_t_, _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s or _k_e_v_e_n_t___q_o_s___s structure.

     EVFILT_READ      Takes a file descriptor as the identifier, and returns
                      whenever there is data available to read.  The behavior
                      of the filter is slightly different depending on the
                      descriptor type.

                      Sockets
                          Sockets which have previously been passed to
                          lliisstteenn() return when there is an incoming connection
                          pending.  _d_a_t_a contains the size of the listen
                          backlog.

                          Other socket descriptors return when there is data
                          to be read, subject to the SO_RCVLOWAT value of the
                          socket buffer.  This may be overridden with a per-
                          filter low water mark at the time the filter is
                          added by setting the NOTE_LOWAT flag in _f_f_l_a_g_s, and
                          specifying the new low water mark in _d_a_t_a.  The
                          derived per filter low water mark value is, however,
                          bounded by socket receive buffer's high and low
                          water mark values.  On return, _d_a_t_a contains the
                          number of bytes of protocol data available to read.

                          The presence of EV_OOBAND in _f_l_a_g_s, indicates the
                          presence of out of band data on the socket _d_a_t_a
                          equal to the potential number of OOB bytes availble
                          to read.

                          If the read direction of the socket has shutdown,
                          then the filter also sets EV_EOF in _f_l_a_g_s, and
                          returns the socket error (if any) in _f_f_l_a_g_s.  It is
                          possible for EOF to be returned (indicating the
                          connection is gone) while there is still data
                          pending in the socket buffer.

                      Vnodes
                          Returns when the file pointer is not at the end of
                          file.  _d_a_t_a contains the offset from current
                          position to end of file, and may be negative.

                      Fifos, Pipes
                          Returns when there is data to read; _d_a_t_a contains
                          the number of bytes available.

                          When the last writer disconnects, the filter will
                          set EV_EOF in _f_l_a_g_s.  This may be cleared by passing
                          in EV_CLEAR, at which point the filter will resume
                          waiting for data to become available before
                          returning.

                      Device nodes
                          Returns when there is data to read from the device;
                          _d_a_t_a contains the number of bytes available.  If the
                          device does not support returning number of bytes,
                          it will not allow the filter to be attached.
                          However, if the NOTE_LOWAT flag is specified and the
                          _d_a_t_a field contains 1 on input, those devices will
                          attach - but cannot be relied upon to provide an
                          accurate count of bytes to be read on output.

     EVFILT_EXCEPT    Takes a descriptor as the identifier, and returns
                      whenever one of the specified exceptional conditions has
                      occurred on the descriptor. Conditions are specified in
                      _f_f_l_a_g_s.  Currently, this filter can be used to monitor
                      the arrival of out-of-band data on a socket descriptor
                      using the filter flag NOTE_OOB.

                      If the read direction of the socket has shutdown, then
                      the filter also sets EV_EOF in _f_l_a_g_s, and returns the
                      socket error (if any) in _f_f_l_a_g_s.

     EVFILT_WRITE     Takes a file descriptor as the identifier, and returns
                      whenever it is possible to write to the descriptor.  For
                      sockets, pipes and fifos, _d_a_t_a will contain the amount
                      of space remaining in the write buffer.  The filter will
                      set EV_EOF when the reader disconnects, and for the fifo
                      case, this may be cleared by use of EV_CLEAR.  Note that
                      this filter is not supported for vnodes.

                      For sockets, the low water mark and socket error
                      handling is identical to the EVFILT_READ case.

     EVFILT_AIO       This filter is currently unsupported.

     EVFILT_VNODE     Takes a file descriptor as the identifier and the events
                      to watch for in _f_f_l_a_g_s, and returns when one or more of
                      the requested events occurs on the descriptor.  The
                      events to monitor are:

                      NOTE_DELETE    The uunnlliinnkk() system call was called on
                                     the file referenced by the descriptor.

                      NOTE_WRITE     A write occurred on the file referenced
                                     by the descriptor.

                      NOTE_EXTEND    The file referenced by the descriptor was
                                     extended.

                      NOTE_ATTRIB    The file referenced by the descriptor had
                                     its attributes changed.

                      NOTE_LINK      The link count on the file changed.

                      NOTE_RENAME    The file referenced by the descriptor was
                                     renamed.

                      NOTE_REVOKE    Access to the file was revoked via
                                     revoke(2) or the underlying fileystem was
                                     unmounted.

                      NOTE_FUNLOCK   The file was unlocked by calling flock(2)
                                     or close(2)

                      On return, _f_f_l_a_g_s contains the filter-specific flags
                      which are associated with the triggered events seen by
                      this filter.

     EVFILT_PROC      Takes the process ID to monitor as the identifier and
                      the events to watch for in _f_f_l_a_g_s, and returns when the
                      process performs one or more of the requested events.
                      If a process can normally see another process, it can
                      attach an event to it.  The events to monitor are:

                      NOTE_EXIT    The process has exited.

                      NOTE_EXITSTATUS
                                   The process has exited and its exit status
                                   is in filter specific data. Valid only on
                                   child processes and to be used along with
                                   NOTE_EXIT.

                      NOTE_FORK    The process created a child process via
                                   fork(2) or similar call.

                      NOTE_EXEC    The process executed a new process via
                                   execve(2) or similar call.

                      NOTE_SIGNAL  The process was sent a signal. Status can
                                   be checked via waitpid(2) or similar call.

                      NOTE_REAP    The process was reaped by the parent via
                                   wait(2) or similar call. Deprecated, use
                                   NOTE_EXIT.

                      On return, _f_f_l_a_g_s contains the events which triggered
                      the filter.

     EVFILT_SIGNAL    Takes the signal number to monitor as the identifier and
                      returns when the given signal is generated for the
                      process.  This coexists with the ssiiggnnaall() and
                      ssiiggaaccttiioonn() facilities, and has a lower precedence.
                      Only signals sent to the process, not to a particular
                      thread, will trigger the filter. The filter will record
                      all attempts to deliver a signal to a process, even if
                      the signal has been marked as SIG_IGN.  Event
                      notification happens before normal signal delivery
                      processing.  _d_a_t_a returns the number of times the signal
                      has been generated since the last call to kkeevveenntt().
                      This filter automatically sets the EV_CLEAR flag
                      internally.

     EVFILT_MACHPORT  Takes the name of a mach port, or port set, in _i_d_e_n_t and
                      waits until a message is enqueued on the port or port
                      set. When a message is detected, but not directly
                      received by the kevent call, the name of the specific
                      port where the message is enqueued is returned in _d_a_t_a.
                      If _f_f_l_a_g_s contains MACH_RCV_MSG, the ext[0] and ext[1]
                      flags are assumed to contain a pointer to the buffer
                      where the message is to be received and the size of the
                      receive buffer, respectively.  If MACH_RCV_MSG is
                      specifed, yet the buffer size in ext[1] is zero, The
                      space for the buffer may be carved out of the data_out
                      area provided to kkeevveenntt__qqooss() if there is enough space
                      remaining there.

     EVFILT_TIMER     Establishes an interval timer identified by _i_d_e_n_t where
                      _d_a_t_a specifies the timeout period (in milliseconds).

                      _f_f_l_a_g_s can include one of the following flags to specify
                      a different unit:

                      NOTE_SECONDS   _d_a_t_a is in seconds

                      NOTE_USECONDS  _d_a_t_a is in microseconds

                      NOTE_NSECONDS  _d_a_t_a is in nanoseconds

                      NOTE_MACHTIME  _d_a_t_a is in Mach absolute time units

                      _f_f_l_a_g_s can also include NOTE_ABSOLUTE, which establishes
                      an EV_ONESHOT timer with an absolute deadline instead of
                      an interval.  The absolute deadline is expressed in
                      terms of gettimeofday(2).  With NOTE_MACHTIME, the
                      deadline is expressed in terms of mmaacchh__aabbssoolluuttee__ttiimmee().

                      The timer can be coalesced with other timers to save
                      power. The following flags can be set in _f_f_l_a_g_s to
                      modify this behavior:

                      NOTE_CRITICAL    override default power-saving
                                       techniques to more strictly respect the
                                       leeway value

                      NOTE_BACKGROUND  apply more power-saving techniques to
                                       coalesce this timer with other timers

                      NOTE_LEEWAY      _e_x_t_[_1_] holds user-supplied slop in
                                       deadline for timer coalescing.

                      The timer will be periodic unless EV_ONESHOT is
                      specified.  On return, _d_a_t_a contains the number of times
                      the timeout has expired since the last arming or last
                      delivery of the timer event.

                      This filter automatically sets the EV_CLEAR flag.

     In the _e_x_t_[_2_] field of the _k_e_v_e_n_t_6_4___s struture, _e_x_t_[_0_] is only used with
     the EVFILT_MACHPORT filter.  With other filters, _e_x_t_[_0_] is passed through
     kkeevveenntt6644() much like _u_d_a_t_a.  _e_x_t_[_1_] can always be used like _u_d_a_t_a.  For
     the use of ext[0], see the EVFILT_MACHPORT filter above.

     The kkqquueeuuee() system call creates a new kernel event queue and returns a
     file descriptor.  If there was an error creating the kernel event queue,
     a value of -1 is returned and errno set.

     The kkeevveenntt(), kkeevveenntt6644() and kkeevveenntt__qqooss() system calls return the number
     of events placed in the _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t, up to the value given by _n_e_v_e_n_t_s.  If
     an error occurs while processing an element of the _c_h_a_n_g_e_l_i_s_t and there
     is enough room in the _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t, then the event will be placed in the
     _e_v_e_n_t_l_i_s_t with EV_ERROR set in _f_l_a_g_s and the system error in _d_a_t_a.
     Otherwise, -1 will be returned, and errno will be set to indicate the
     error condition.  If the time limit expires, then kkeevveenntt(), kkeevveenntt6644()
     and kkeevveenntt__qqooss() return 0.
